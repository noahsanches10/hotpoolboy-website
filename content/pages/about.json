        "description": "\nBorn and raised in Utah, I’ve always loved the changing seasons—especially summer, with winter coming in as a close second. Whether it’s diving into a cool pool on a scorching day or unwinding in a hot tub on a snowy night, I know how important it is to keep your water amenities in perfect shape all year round.\n\nThat’s why I make pool and spa care effortless. From balancing chemicals to tackling stubborn grime, I ensure every pool and spa is crystal-clear, stress-free, and ready for your next soak or swim. My goal? To deliver expert service with a touch of personality—because great maintenance should come with a friendly face.\n\n\"There’s always a chance you could catch me taking a quick dip before I head out—but don’t worry, I promise I’ll be out before you notice!\"\n",

My ride ensures I get to your service on time and out before you notice—though, let’s be real, you’ll probably hear me a mile away. \n\nAs for the gym, that’s where I train for the real challenge—battling grime and gunk in your pool or spa. Thanks to my dedication (and maybe a few extra arm days), your water stays pristine.\n\nThe Hot Pool Boys bring muscle, precision, and top-tier service—so you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the splash!\n",
