          "question": "How often should I have my pool professionally serviced?",
          "answer": "For pools in the Salt Lake Valley area, we recommend weekly or bi-weekly service during the swimming season (typically May through September) and monthly maintenance during the off-season. This ensures proper water chemistry, cleanliness, and equipment function year-round."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's included in your pool and spa maintenance service?",
          "answer": "Our comprehensive service includes water chemistry testing and balancing, cleaning and skimming, filter maintenance, equipment checks, and surface cleaning. We bring all necessary testing equipment, chemicals, and cleaning tools to keep your pool or spa in perfect condition."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you offer seasonal pool opening and closing services?",
          "answer": "Yes! We provide complete seasonal services for pools throughout Salt Lake, Davis, and Utah counties. Our opening service includes cover removal, system startup, thorough cleaning, and initial chemical balancing. Closing service prepares your pool for Utah's winter with proper chemical treatment, equipment winterization, and secure cover installation."
        },
        {
          "question": "How often should hot tub water be changed?",
          "answer": "For residential hot tubs in the Salt Lake area, we recommend changing the water every 3-4 months. However, with our professional maintenance service, proper chemical balance, and regular filter cleaning, your spa water stays cleaner longer and might require less frequent changes."
